# Mechanism Simulation
This C# application simulates the behavior of a simple kinematic mechanism, allowing users to modify various mechanical parameters to observe changes in motion. The project follows the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design pattern, ensuring a clean separation of logic, presentation, and user interaction for easier maintenance
