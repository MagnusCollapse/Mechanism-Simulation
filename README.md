# Mechanism Simulation
This C# application simulates the behavior of a simple kinematic mechanism, allowing users to modify various mechanical parameters to observe changes in motion. The project follows the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design pattern, ensuring a clean separation of logic, presentation, and user interaction for easier maintenance

## Skills Gained
-Simulation Logic in C# – Developed algorithms to model real-world mechanical behavior.
-Parameter-Driven Modeling – Implemented dynamic input handling to simulate various configurations.
-MVP Pattern Application – Structured the app for better modularity and ease of future development.
